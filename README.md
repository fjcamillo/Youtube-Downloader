# Simple Implementation of PyVideo

This project is a simple hands free youtube video downloader. You only need to collect the youtube links. The code will be the one to distinguish if the youtube video is already downloaded or not

# HOWTO

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
or
Run `pipenv install`

Create a `to_dl.txt` and `dled.txt` file

Place your youtube links inside the to_dl.txt file, each link must be separated by a newline

Run `python main.py` to start downloading videos
